# 5-Day-AI-Agents-Intensive-Course-with-Google X Kaggle

### Description
This repository documents my learnings, experiments, and Kaggle notebooks completed as part of the “**5 Day AI Agents Intensive Course**” conducted by **Google x Kaggle**.

The course focuses on AI agents—autonomous systems that can plan, use tools, coordinate, and reliably complete complex, multi-step tasks. It teaches you how to move AI agents from simple LLM prototypes to production-ready systems

| **Day 1** | *Introduction to Agents*                  | Foundational concepts of AI agents and their architectures | Understanding agent characteristics, how agentic architectures differ from traditional LLM apps, and building intelligent, autonomous systems |
| **Day 2** | *Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP* | Tools, actions, and external API integrations              | Learn how AI agents take actions using tools and APIs, and explore the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for interoperability                      |
| **Day 3** | *Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory*  | Memory and context retention                               | Implement short-term and long-term memory for robust agents capable of handling complex, multi-turn interactions                              |
| **Day 4** | *Agent Quality*                           | Evaluation, observability, and performance optimization    | Master techniques for improving agent reliability, tracing, logging, and defining metrics to optimize agent performance                       |
| **Day 5** | *Prototype to Production*                 | Deployment and scalability                                 | Learn best practices for scaling and deploying AI agents, including multi-agent systems using the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol                  |
