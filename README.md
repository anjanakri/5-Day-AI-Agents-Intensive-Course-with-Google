# 5-Day-AI-Agents-Intensive-Course-with-Google X Kaggle

### Description
This repository documents my learnings, experiments, and Kaggle notebooks completed as part of the “**5 Day AI Agents Intensive Course**” conducted by **Google x Kaggle**.

The course focuses on AI agents—autonomous systems that can plan, use tools, coordinate, and reliably complete complex, multi-step tasks. It teaches you how to move AI agents from simple LLM prototypes to production-ready systems
